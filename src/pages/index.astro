            As a seasoned Frontend Engineer with 6+ years of experience, I
            specialize in crafting engaging and scalable user interfaces for web
            and mobile applications. Proficient in ReactJS and NextJS, I excel
            in building fast, efficient, and maintainable web applications.
            Additionally, my expertise in React Native enables me to develop
            seamless and intuitive mobile experiences.
